            CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial
            websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s
            reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or
            company in the United States (and conceivable the world) that
            operates websites collecting personally identifiable information
            from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on
            its website stating exactly the information being collected and
            those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with
            this policy. – See more at:
